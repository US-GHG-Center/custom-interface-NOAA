Measurements from the Mauna Kea Observatory (MKO), 21 miles to the northeast are substituted during this time period to fill in the Mauna Loa record. The Mauna Kea quality-controlled measurements are noted using coral color. NRT data is shown in blue and is substituted with quality controlled data as it becomes available."
